# D20 FireVerse

The TV is the table: a **5E-compatible** d20 RPG for the living room, built for Amazon Fire TV and a
plain remote. Nobody has to run the game. The server rolls every die in the open, a neural narrator
reads every scene aloud with synced subtitles — and every character speaks with a voice of their own —
and the party decides the rest, from the couch with the D-pad or from their phones.

**North star:** a Fire TV Stick and Alexa as one fully immersive table — screen, remote, voice,
lights and Echo on the same server. See [`docs/NORTH_STAR.md`](docs/NORTH_STAR.md).

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run build          # TV + companion bundles
npm run dev:backend    # table server on http://127.0.0.1:3100/ (serves the built TV and /companion)
```

For development, run the hot-reload clients next to the server:

```bash
npm run dev:tv         # http://127.0.0.1:4317/            proxies /ws and /api to :3100
npm run dev:companion  # http://127.0.0.1:4319/companion/  the phone seat
```

Checks (the same as CI):

```bash
npm run typecheck && NARRATION=off npm test && npm run build
```

## The adventure

*A Very Potent Brew* is a one-shot of about fifteen minutes to the boss: a job at the tavern, the
descent into the Wizard's Tower brewery, a mosaic hub with three seals to win (tile, vessel, well and
alchemy puzzles, plus rat and centipede fights), the Infernal Spider behind the Door of Three Seals,
and a Magma Rat cliffhanger. Every scene is a checkpoint: **Continue** on the title screen picks the
table back up, and a lost table resumes from its last autosave.

Heroes are four painted SRD pregens (level 3) or your own, forged on the TV from SRD 5.1 rules —
race, class, background, ability scores (standard array, point buy or 4d6-drop-lowest, with a
one-press "Recommended for {class}" layout), skills, spells, name and portrait.

## The remote is all you need

| Key | At the table |
|-----|--------------|
| D-pad | Move between choices · aim on the board |
| OK / Select | Choose · in combat: move to the cursor or strike what it's on |
| Back | Cancel · step out of a menu · on the title screen of the Fire TV app, press twice to leave |
| Menu | Settings (volumes, voice, subtitles, motion, contrast, remote guide) |
| Play/Pause | Hear the last line again · in combat: end turn |
| Rewind / Fast-forward | Sheet tabs in combat |

On a keyboard: arrows, Enter, Esc/Backspace, `S` (settings), `M` (music), `1`–`9` (choices).

In combat the cursor starts on the best target: **OK** walks you into reach, **OK** again strikes
with your ★ attack. Every other action (Dash, Dodge, spells, potions…) waits below the board — press
**▼**. Foe turns play out step by step, and every roll lands a 3D d20 on the server's value with the
result stated against the target's AC (HIT / MISS / CRITICAL). A first-fight coach explains each step
once; *Settings → Show first-fight tips again* brings it back.

## Phones (companion)

Each signed-in TV shows **its own** one-time QR code (title and lobby). The phone that scans it
becomes that player's personal controller — no login on the phone, and an unpaired phone shows only
the camera. The QR then gives way to a *Phone linked* card. The link ends on Log out, on going back
to the title from a table, or when the TV app closes (45 s grace, `CONSOLE_GRACE_MS`); the phone
returns to the camera and scans again.

The phone follows that TV: title, campaign, arena, lobby, story and combat. Once the TV sits with a
hero, the phone shows that hero's full sheet and the player's own buttons (story choices, votes,
checks, actions, End turn). **Swipe** the die pad to throw: the die lands on the TV and the total
appears on the phone. The **Mouse** switch adds a trackpad under the sheet — drag moves a pointer on
the TV, tap is OK — so the hero can be picked from the phone too; the remote keeps working and the
last command wins.

If a seated player drops mid-fight for more than 20 s (`DROP_GRACE_MS`) while others are still at
the table, their hero Dodges and passes the turn so nobody is held hostage. If nobody is watching,
the table simply pauses.

## Voices

Narration and dialogue are rendered **on the table server** with
[Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) (Apache-2.0) through `kokoro-js`, cached on
disk by text hash in `backend/data/narration/` and served as AAC with per-sentence timings, so the TV
highlights each line as it is spoken (karaoke subtitles). The first boot downloads the full-precision
ONNX model (~310 MB, cached by transformers.js under `node_modules/@huggingface/transformers/.cache/`)
and pre-renders every scripted line in the background; after that every line is instant.

**Every character has their own voice.** Story text marks spoken lines as `[[speaker: line]]`; the
server renders each piece with that character's Kokoro voice, shifts its pitch and places it in a room
(stone echo, cavern, hiss, growl) with `ffmpeg`, then levels every speaker to the same loudness. On the
TV the line becomes a quote signed with the speaker's name in their colour, a nameplate with a voice
meter rises over the scene while they talk, and combat subtitles carry their name.

| Character | Voice | Colour | Treatment |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Narrator | `bm_george` | — | dry, warm |
| Glowkindle, rock gnome brewmaster | `am_puck` | green | pitched up, quick |
| The Messenger | `bf_emma` | amber | natural |
| The Tower Wizard (poem, notes) | `bm_fable` | violet | slow, lower, stone echo |
| The Well | `af_nicole` | pale blue | whispered, deep cavern |
| Infernal Spider | `af_bella` | ember | pitched down, hissing chorus |
| Magma Rat | `am_fenrir` | orange | far lower, growled |

The cast lives in the campaign manifest (`content/campaigns/luppolandia-brew/manifest.json → cast`):
name, title, colour, `voice`, `speed`, `pitch` and `fx` (`echo`, `cavern`, `hiss`, `growl`). Changing
any of them re-renders only the affected lines. A test fails if a line names someone who is not cast,
or if two characters would sound the same.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `NARRATION` | on | `off` disables the neural voice (tests, low-power hosts) |
| `NARRATOR_VOICE` | `bm_george` | Any Kokoro voice id for the narrator |
| `NARRATOR_SPEED` | `0.94` | Narrator speaking rate |
| `NARRATOR_MODEL` | `onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX` | Hugging Face model id |
| `NARRATOR_DTYPE` | `fp32` | Model precision. `q8` is 3× smaller but bursts into loud glitches mid-sentence |

Without the model (offline, `NARRATION=off`, or a failed render) the TV falls back to the device's
speech synthesis, still pitching each character differently, and subtitles always show. `ffmpeg` on
`PATH` provides AAC and the character treatments; without it clips are served as WAV in plain voices.

## Sound

- **Score** — seven original looping cues that crossfade with the scene and duck under the narrator,
  written and synthesized in [`tools/music/compose.py`](tools/music/compose.py).
- **Effects** — dice, blades, arrows, claws, spells, hits, deaths, footsteps and UI ticks, all
  synthesized by [`tools/sfx/render.py`](tools/sfx/render.py). Nothing is sampled.

```bash
pip install -r tools/music/requirements.txt && python3 tools/music/compose.py
pip install -r tools/sfx/requirements.txt   && python3 tools/sfx/render.py
```

| Cue | Plays on |
|-----|----------|
| A Very Potent Brew | Title screen |
| Jig at the Wizard's Tower | Lobby, tavern scenes |
| What Lies Beneath | Brewery rooms, puzzles |
| Noise from the Deep | Ember beats before fights |
| Steel in the Cellar | Combat |
| The Infernal Weaver | Spider and magma fights |
| Three Seals, One Toast | Victory |

## Fire TV app

[`firetv/`](firetv/) is the living-room app: a Kotlin WebView shell for Fire TV and Android TV
(Fire OS 5 / Android 5.1 and later) that puts the table full screen with autoplaying narration.

**Install** the signed build from [`releases/firetv/`](releases/firetv/) (≈ 570 KB):

- *Downloader app* — on the Fire TV enable *Settings → My Fire TV → Developer options → Install unknown
  apps* for Downloader, then open the raw GitHub URL of the APK.
- *adb* — enable *ADB debugging* in the same menu, then
  `adb connect <fire-tv-ip>:5555 && adb install -r releases/firetv/d20-fireverse-firetv-1.0.1.apk`.

Signing certificate SHA-256 `C4:F4:D8:23:62:4C:6C:5B:F1:84:E6:74:5F:43:54:45:52:80:70:88:F7:81:FC:67:2B:A5:89:65:18:DB:CA:E7`
(`apksigner verify --print-certs`). Updates install over it only when signed with the same key. 1.0.0
was signed with a throwaway CI key: uninstall it once before installing 1.0.1.

**Login with Amazon** is the main sign-in on the Stick once the SDK, an API key and the server keys are
in place; until then the test account is offered. Setup: [`docs/AMAZON_LOGIN.md`](docs/AMAZON_LOGIN.md).

**First launch** finds the table by itself: the server announces `_fireverse._tcp` over mDNS
(`ANNOUNCE=off` to silence it) and the app lists every table on the Wi‑Fi — with one table it sits
down straight away. It can also take a typed address (`192.168.1.20` or `192.168.1.20:3100`), checks
that a FireVerse server answers before connecting, and remembers it for next time. If the server goes
away, or the TV's WebView keeps crashing, the app comes back to this screen and says why instead of
showing a browser error or a black screen. *Settings → Change table
server* switches tables from inside the game.

The remote works exactly as on the web table: the WebView forwards the D-pad and OK, and the app hands
Back, Menu, Play/Pause, Rewind and Fast-forward to the page. Back only leaves the app from the title
screen, and asks twice.

**Build** (JDK 17+, Android SDK 35):

```bash
cd firetv
./gradlew assembleRelease                              # app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
./gradlew assembleRelease -Pfireverse.tableUrl=http://192.168.1.20:3100   # bake in a default table
```

Release signing reads `FIREVERSE_KEYSTORE`, `FIREVERSE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `FIREVERSE_KEY_ALIAS` and
`FIREVERSE_KEY_PASSWORD`; without them the release build is signed with the debug key (CI does this and
publishes the APK as a build artifact). Launcher banner, icons and splash come from the game's art:
`python3 firetv/scripts/make-launcher-art.py`. Store-size art is in [`firetv/store/`](firetv/store/).

## Accessibility

Settings (Menu) persist per TV: music / narrator / effects volumes, spoken or silent narrator,
subtitles on/off and size, **reduced motion** (no camera moves, Ken Burns or shake; the die snaps to
its face), and **high-contrast board** (brighter reach cells, thicker rings and outlines). Errors are
written for people, never as server codes.
